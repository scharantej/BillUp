## Flask Application Design for Biller Ingestion and Update

### HTML Files

#### 1. `index.html`:
- Home page of the application.
- Provides a form to upload a CSV file containing biller information.
- Has a button to trigger the biller ingestion process.

#### 2. `success.html`:
- Confirmation page displayed after successful biller ingestion.
- Displays a message confirming the number of billers ingested.
- Provides a link to return to the home page.

#### 3. `error.html`:
- Error page displayed when biller ingestion fails.
- Displays an error message explaining the cause of the failure.
- Provides a link to return to the home page.

### Routes

#### 1. `/`:
- Route for the home page.
- Displays the `index.html` file.

#### 2. `/ingest`:
- Route for handling the biller ingestion process.
- Receives a POST request with the CSV file containing biller information.
- Parses the CSV file and extracts biller data.
- Saves the biller data to the database.
- Redirects to the `success.html` page on successful ingestion or the `error.html` page on failure.

#### 3. `/success`:
- Route for displaying the success page.
- Displays the `success.html` file.

#### 4. `/error`:
- Route for displaying the error page.
- Displays the `error.html` file.

### Additional Considerations

- The database for storing biller information can be any popular SQL or NoSQL database, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB.
- The application should handle various error conditions that may arise during biller ingestion, such as invalid CSV format, duplicate biller records, etc.
- The application can be expanded to include additional features, such as biller update, deletion, and search.
- The design of the UI can be customized to match the specific requirements of the application.
